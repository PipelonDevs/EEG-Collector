## EEG Collector

The goal is to create a simple tool that will greatly simplify the collection, visualization and annotation of data.

#### Annotation JSON Format

This JSON format is used to store metadata and data related to EEG recordings.

## Structure

The JSON file is divided into two main sections: `meta` and `data`.

#### Meta

The `meta` section contains the following fields:

- `clock_rate`: The number of records generated by the device per second.
- `channels`: The number of channels from which the device records data.
- `displayable_rows`: dictionary with data You want to visualize:
    - key: name of channel (e.g "alpa", "beta mid") 
    - value: list of rows 
- `notes`: Any additional notes or comments about the recording or the subject.

### Data

The `data` section is an array of objects, each representing a segment of the recording. Each object contains the following fields:

- `start`: The start row of the segment in the data array.
- `end`: The end row of the segment in the data array.
- `label`: A label indicating the type of activity or state that was occurring during this segment (e.g., "baseline", "boredom").
